## 📚 Project Documentation

Here are the essential documents for our team. Please read them\!

  * **[📜 The Project Subject](docs/subject.md)**

      * The official `ft_irc` project requirements.

  * **[🛠️ Team Workflow Guide](docs/workflow.md)**

      * **Very Important\!** Read this to understand our Git branching rules and how we use `.clang-format` to keep the code clean.

  * **[💡 Project Division Plan](docs/idea.md)**

      * A guide on how we can separate the project into logical parts for our team.

  * **[🤖 AI Socratic Tutor Prompt](docs/cs-tutor.md)**

      * A great prompt to use with an AI (like me\!) to get help. It makes the AI ask you guiding questions instead of just giving you the code.
